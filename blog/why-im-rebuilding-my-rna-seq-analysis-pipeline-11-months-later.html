          Eleven months ago, I dove into RNA-seq analysis for the first time, uncertain but determined to rewrite my science career. After years of orbiting the medical field, I realized what I truly loved was the complexity of disease, not treating it, but decoding it. This project began as a Youtube tutorial by Bioinformagician and quickly became a springboard into deeper work. Now, I‚Äôm revisiting it with sharper tools, a structured plan, and clearer goals.

        <p class="mb-4">
          Since my first pipeline, I have completed one year of formal coursework from my Master‚Äôs program, gained hands-on project experience, and started thinking critically about quality control, reproducibility, and how to compare different RNA-seq analysis strategies.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          My only pipeline was not a failure, but a foundation. I now understand that bioinformatics is not just about running code. It is about making informed decisions at each step and knowing how these choices affect interpretation.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-1xl text-[#0a192f] font-semibold mb-2">Why Rebuild the RNA-seq Pipeline?</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>
            <strong>RNA-seq results do not start at the analysis step.</strong> Every quality control and preprocessing effort can alter biological conclusions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The same dataset can lead to very different biological conclusions,</strong> depending on the normalization strategy, statistical test, or clustering method used.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>I realized I did not fully understand the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind the steps before.</strong> Now, I want to challenge and compare them not just technically, but biologically.

              <li><strong>Goal: </strong>Establish a clean, reproducible, modular pipeline for RNA-seq analysis using best practices.</li>
              <li><strong>Why it Matters: </strong>Without quality preprocessing, downstream results are unreliable and misleading.</li>

              <li><strong>Why it Matters: </strong>Choosing the right method is not just a technical decision. It is also a scientific one. Method selection can determine which genes you report, how you group them, and which hypotheses you pursue.</li>

        <p class="mb-4">
          I am not just building a better pipeline, I am building confidence in my own scientific reasoning.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          This process is not perfect, but science rarely is. I have learned a lot, but I am also still learning. If you are curious how different RNA-seq strategies influence biological interpretation, follow along. This is not just about code. It‚Äôs about insight.
